# Drug Performance in Mice with SCC üêÅ
[pymaceuticals.ipynb](pymaceuticals.ipynb) is a technical report of data gathered in a study that tracks the effect of vaious drug regimens on the tumor size of mice with squamous cell carcinoma ([SCC](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/squamous-cell-carcinoma/)), a commonly occuring form of skin cancer.

## Analysis tools
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)

## Observations
* The mice observed in the study were evenly distributed by sex.
* There was a strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume, though the tumor itself could have attributed to the mouse weight measurement.
* Between 4 treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) there was only one outlier when looking at the average final tumor volume.
